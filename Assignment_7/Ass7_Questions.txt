Q.1) Create the application which contains two components as First and second Display specific text from both the component. Text of first component should be displayed in Red colour and for second component use Blue colour.

(Follow same steps as the above application. As we want to specify the colours we have to
write the colours specification in appropriate .css file of each component.)


Q.2) Create angular application which contains one user defined function inside class named as fun. We have to call that function using String interpolation. That function should return string as “Marvellous Infosystems”

( Write one public function inside class named as fun() and call that function inside {{ call }}. )


Q.3) Create angular application which contains one button. When user press that button we have to display some text as “Educating for Better tomorrow” otherwise display “Marvellous Infosystems”.

( As we want to handle event of button click we have to use this tag as (click)= “fun()”. In this
case inside the fun function we will change the text. )


Q.4) Create angular application which contains two buttons as UPPER & LOWER. When user press UPPER button then display text as “MARVELLOUS INFOSYSTEMS” and if user press lower button then display text as “marvellous infosystems”. String should be the part of class characteristics.
