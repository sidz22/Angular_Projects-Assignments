Q1) Create application which will display one textfield and one static text “Marvellous Infosystems” on page.

Follow all the steps to create new project and update app.component.html file. In this file add code to display one static text and one text field.


Q2) Create application which will display one textfield and one static text “Marvellous Infosystems” on page. Colour of that text should be blue.

Follow same steps as above application.

As we want to specify colour add the specification in app.component.css file and see the
changes.


Q3) Create same angular application as above but instead of using app.component.html and app.component.css file separately add its contents in inline format inside app.component.ts file.

(Same as the inline html we have to use the inline css contents in app.component.ts file.)


Q4) Create angular application which will demonstrate the concept of string interpolation. For this purpose create new component named as NewComp and render that from App component. Inside that new component add one class property as name.

1.Display that Name in small case.
2.Display that Name in capital case.
3.Display Name of string.
4.Display new string after concatenation with “Infosystems”.

To demonstrate the string interpolation create one characteristics in class as “Name” which should be assigned to some string as

Name = “Marvellous”
Now use this characteristics in html file using the concept of string interpolation as {{Name}}
