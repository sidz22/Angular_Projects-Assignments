### Angular Assignments Repository  

This repository contains the solutions to Angular class assignments that I have completed independently. These assignments are a crucial part of my learning journey, helping me to:  
- Apply the concepts learned in class to practical problems.  
- Strengthen my understanding of Angular fundamentals.  
- Develop problem-solving skills and logical thinking in web development.  
- Explore and implement Angular features such as components, directives, services, routing, and more.  

### What's Inside  
Each folder contains a specific assignment question in a .txt file, the src folder with my solution code, and a screenshot of the output.
### Note  
I am uploading only the `src` files for each assignment. If you would like to run these solutions, follow the steps below:  

1. **Set Up a New Angular Project**:  
   Create a new Angular project using Angular CLI:  
   ```bash  
   ng new <project-name>  
   ```  

2. **Replace the `src` Folder**:  
   Copy the `src` folder from the assignment you wish to run and replace it in the newly created project.  

3. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Navigate to the project directory and install all necessary dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  

4. **Run the Project**:  
   Start the development server:  
   ```bash  
   ng serve  
   ```  

   Access the project in your browser at `http://localhost:4200`.  

### Acknowledgment  
These assignments have been a valuable learning experience, helping me build a strong foundation in Angular and its applications.
